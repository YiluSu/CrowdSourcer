CrowdSourcer
============

CrowdSourcer is a tiny webservice consisting of too many lines of code.

It stores JSON chunks, gives them IDs and lets you list and delete them.

You can execute the following actions

* post - create a new entry with a summary description and content field. content must be JSON compliant or empty

* update - update a post identified by an id with summary, description, and content.

* remove - provide a valid id and an entry will be removed.

* list - optional argument n will list n recent items

* get - id argument will allow you retrieve 

* nuke - accompanied by a key "judgedredd" allows you to nuke the database and lockfiles because something messed up, or you did!
